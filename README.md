# Resume of Job Douma (2022)
This repository contains the 2022 version of my resume, showcasing my skills and experiences as a computer science graduate. The resume is designed to be easy to read and understand, highlighting my key achievements and areas of expertise. This project is open source and available for anyone to view and use as inspiration for their own resume.

### Motivation
I am motivated to share my resume on GitHub because I believe that making it open source allows others to use it as a reference or inspiration for their own resumes. Sharing my resume on a platform like GitHub also allows me to showcase my skills and experiences to a wider audience and potentially attract new job opportunities. Additionally, making my resume open source allows me to receive feedback and suggestions from the community, helping me to continually improve and update it.

Please note that this resume is outdated and will be updated with the 2023 version.
